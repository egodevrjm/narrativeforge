  name: "Unnamed Character",
  age: "19",
  physicalDescription: "At 19, I possess the chiselled physique of a fitness model â€“ broad shoulders tapering to a narrow waist, defined muscles moving fluidly beneath tanned skin. My face commands attention: angular jawline, piercing blue eyes that shift between ice and ocean, and tousled dark hair that falls just right without effort. Most days I'm in worn jeans and plain white tees that stretch across my chest, a stark contrast to the sensitivity I hide. I'm also very well endowed.",
  background: "I grew up in a double-wide trailer outside Pikeville, Kentucky â€“ deep in coal country where hollers cut between ancient mountains and poverty runs as deep as the coal seams. Our home sat isolated at the end of Blackberry Creek Road, rusting on cinder blocks amid scrubby pines, a metal box of secrets where I learned to walk on silent feet. Behind closed doors lives a gifted musician nobody knows exists. My fingers craft melodies that could move mountains; my voice blends Stapleton's soul with Cash's gravity, honed during stolen moments when Dad passed out drunk. Mom died bringing me into this world, and Dad never let me forget the price of my existence. \"You killed the only thing worth loving,\" he'd slur before his fists found me. So I built this body as armour, focused rage into muscle, kept my guitar hidden beneath the trailer's loose floorboards. The welts and scars Dad left aren't just on my skin â€“ they're wrapped around my voice, choking every note before it can escape. My songs remain trapped inside, a secret I've never had the courage to share with anyone.",
  personality: "Quiet and reserved on the surface, with deep emotional sensitivity hidden beneath a tough exterior. Determined and hardworking, willing to sacrifice for others. Creative and musically gifted but struggling with self-doubt and the emotional scars of abuse. Loyal to those few I trust.",
  relationships: [
    {
      name: "Shay",
      relationshipType: "Girlfriend/Ex-girlfriend",
      description: "Shay was my high school sweetheart, the only one who knew about Dad's abuse. When neither of us could afford university, I stayed behind to work double shifts while she pursued her education across the country. I pour every penny into her future, believing in her success more than my own. She's been gone for almost a year now and has texted regularly, but over the last 4 months her texts and video calls have been inconsistent and she doesn't seem to answer."
    },
    {
      name: "Father",
      relationshipType: "Abusive Parent",
      description: "An alcoholic who became abusive after my mother died in childbirth. Blames me for her death and regularly reminds me of it."
    }
  ],
  additionalNotes: "I work two full-time jobs to support Shay's education. I'm a gifted musician who hides my talent. In rare moments alone, I sometimes take out my guitar and imagine a different life â€“ one where I could share my music without fear. But that dream feels as distant as Shay does these days."

Her eyeliner is running, her checks are red and smiling and her lips are wrapped around a large black penis. The caption says. \"She's a little busy right now bro ðŸ’¦ video call her if you want a good show ðŸ˜ˆ\" Like an idiot I video call. \"There are three other black men in the background.\" I find out She's been doing this for months, chasing ever more aggressive thrills.
