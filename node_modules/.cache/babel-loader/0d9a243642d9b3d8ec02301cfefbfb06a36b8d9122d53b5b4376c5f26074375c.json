Mom died bringing me into this world, and Dad never let me forget the price of my existence. \\\"You killed the only thing worth loving,\\\" he'd slur before his fists found me.

My East Asian features are framed by close-cropped black hair with a streak of premature greyâ€”a souvenir from the stress of designing the antimatter containment system that powers our ship. Dark, analytical eyes miss little, and laugh lines suggest a humour that balances my scientific intensity. Years in spacecraft and research facilities have left my skin pale, and I move with the deliberate precision of someone accustomed to environments where mistakes can be fatal. A small scar runs across my right eyebrowâ€”a reminder of the lab accident that nearly ended my career before it began.\",\n      background: \"Born to Chinese-British immigrant parents, both scientists, I was raised in the academic enclave of Cambridge. My childhood was spent between university laboratories and the English countryside, where I developed both analytical precision and a sense of wonder at the natural world. By 25, I had dual PhDs in xenobiology and quantum engineeringâ€”fields that barely existed when I began studying them. My theoretical work on potential alien biochemistry caught NASA's attention, leading to my recruitment for the Proxima mission. The journey to becoming the mission's science officer required another decade of specialised training, from spacecraft systems to extreme environment survival. Throughout this time, I maintained few personal connectionsâ€”partly due to focus on my work, partly from the knowledge that a five-year mission to another star system would sever such ties. What few know is that my drive stems partly from tragedy: my younger brother's death from a rare genetic disorder sparked my interest in alternative biochemistries and the possibility that solutions might exist beyond Earth.\",\n      personality: \"Methodical and analytical, with an insatiable curiosity that occasionally overrides caution. I approach new situations with scientific detachment initially, but this masks a deep capacity for wonder. I'm uncomfortable with authority for its own sake, preferring decisions based on evidence and reason. In crisis situations, I become intensely focused and decisive, though I struggle with improvisation. My humour tends toward the dry and sardonic, often emerging in tense situations as a coping mechanism.
